## Ruby Refresher - Friday test!

A fun challenge. A series of tests have been written in RSpec - it was my job to make these tests pass by implenting a method. See below for details!

### The Brief

Here we're going to revisit the basics of Ruby. There are 41 questions. They vary in level from quite easy to fairly hard. Work through them and check if they're correct by running the specs.

You should be able to answer most questions with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods. If you're writing a long, complex solution, there's probably a better way.

To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

**Quick tip**: to run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus
~~~

### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual
